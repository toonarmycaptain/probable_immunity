"Vaccine Effectiveness
One dose
1 dose of MMR vaccine is—
93% effective for measles (range: 39%–100%)
78% effective for mumps (range: 49%−92%)
97% effective for rubella (range: 94%–100%)"

Presumptive immunity:
    - 1+ dose of vaccine
    - lab evidence of immunity/antibodies or illness
    - birth before 1957

"In the United States, rubella vaccine is available in combination with mumps
 and measles (MMR) vaccine or as a quadrivalent vaccine in combination with
 measles, mumps, and varicella (MMRV). One dose of the vaccine administered at
 12 or more months of age is immunogenic in more than 95% of recipients and
 confers lifelong immunity in more than 90% of vaccinees; the seroconversion
 rate is 99% after two doses of the MMR vaccine.
Reinfection after vaccination is rare."

"A second dose of MMR is recommended to produce immunity to measles and mumps
 in those who failed to respond to the first dose. Data indicate that almost
 all persons who do not respond to the measles component of the first dose will
 respond to a second dose of MMR. Few data on the immune response to the
 rubella and mumps components of a second dose of MMR are available. However,
 most persons who do not respond to the rubella or mumps component of the
 first MMR dose would be expected to respond to the second dose. The second
 dose is not generally considered a booster dose because a primary immune
 response to the first dose provides long-term protection. Although a second
 dose of vaccine may increase antibody titers in some persons who responded
 to the first dose, available data indicate that these increased antibody
 titers are not sustained. The combined MMR vaccine is recommended for both
 doses to ensure immunity to all three viruses."

-> second dose will give immunity for those who did not respond to first dose,
but will not confer better or increased likelihood of immunity in those who
already show some immunity.

"This recommendation is based on serologic studies which indicate that among
 hospital personnel born before 1957, 5% to 9% had no detectable measles
  antibody."
