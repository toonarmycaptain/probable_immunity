"MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine
is about 88% (range: 31-95%) effective when a person gets two doses; one dose
is about 78% (range: 49%−92%) effective. Children may also get MMRV vaccine,
which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox)."

"During these outbreaks, people who previously had one or two doses of MMR
vaccine can get mumps too. Experts aren’t sure why vaccinated people still get
mumps; it could be that their immune system didn’t respond as well as it
should have to the vaccine. Or their immune system’s ability to fight the
infection decreased over time. Disease symptoms are milder and complications
are less frequent in vaccinated people. Also, high vaccination coverage helps
to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. So it’s still
very important to be up to date on MMR vaccine."

"During a mumps outbreak, public health authorities might recommend an
additional dose of MMR vaccine for people who belong to groups at increased
risk for getting mumps. These groups are usually those who are likely to have
close contact, such as sharing sport equipment or drinks, kissing, or living
in close quarters, with a person who has mumps. Your local public health
authorities or institution will notify you if you are at increased risk and
should receive this dose. If you already have two doses of MMR, it is not
necessary to seek out vaccination unless the authorities tell you that
you are part of this group."

NB The current iterations of these algorithms have one-dose immunity greater
than two dose immunity for a birth year before 1942 (ie birth_year <= 1941),
but since persons this age are unlikely to have had shots, and this difference
is a small fraction of a percent, this is considered an acceptable inaccuracy.
