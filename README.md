## Probable immunity

Website showing user possible chance of immunity to various illnesses and risk of contracting those illnesses following exposure.

**probable_immunity** packages statistical data from various sources into a tool that can be used to give an idea of the chance that a given individual might be immune to a given illness, based on supplied vaccination and age information. 

It should not be confused with medical advice or taken as accurate on an individual basis in any way. Please consult a qualified medical authority for medical advice. 

Future path includes:
    - Adding more illnesses/vaccinations.
    - Add likelyhood of an encounter with illness, use context/geographic location to infer likelyhood, and effectiveness of vaccines used in different regions. 
    - Potentially spinning off immunity likelyhood elements into a separate package. 
    - Consider creating database taking minimal PI, for potential research purposes.
